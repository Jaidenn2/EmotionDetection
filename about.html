        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>My goal for this project was to create a machine that was able to detect emotion. In the end I was able to succesfully do this and have a playful twist when it did detect. When you are angry the screen gets a green tint like you are the hulk. When you are sad it will generate a random dad joke to cheer you up and last when you are surprised it will play a loud sound making you surprised. I would like to give credit to Kazuki Umeda on youtube for his tutorial.  </p>
